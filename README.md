# SOL25 PHP Interpreter (Partial)

This repository contains **my implementation** of the interpreter for the SOL25 language, written in PHP, as part of the **IPP 2024/2025 project** at FIT VUT.


## ⚠️ Note

This is **only a part** of the full interpreter — specifically, the PHP part responsible for interpreting the XML-based abstract syntax tree (AST).  
It was written as an individual contribution to the university project.

> ⚠️ This code **will not work standalone**. It depends on the IPP core infrastructure and must be integrated into the full project structure to run correctly.

## Documentation

Details about the implementation and project assignment can be found in the [readme2.md](readme2.md) file.

## Testing

The tests used for this project were kindly provided by a colleague — many thanks!
